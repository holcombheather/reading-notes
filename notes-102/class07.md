A JavaScript function is a block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. It can accept input, called parameters or arguments, and can return a value. Functions are used to organize code and make it more reusable and modular.

## What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

Invoking, or calling, a function means executing or running the code within the function. When a function is called, any parameters or arguments that are passed in are used by the function to perform its tasks. The function may also return a value back to the calling code.

## What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

Parenthesis () are used to define a function's parameters. Parameters are inputs that a function can accept to perform its tasks. When a function is called, the arguments passed into the function are placed inside the parenthesis, and these values are used by the function to perform its tasks. If a function does not require any parameters, the parenthesis will still be present but will be empty.
