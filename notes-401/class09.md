## Readings

### Read today’s (Lab Requirements)[https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-09/lab/]

Note: Requirement is to spend one lab session working on this project, however additional time may be an option. Due date will be given in class and we’ll present briefly at the beginning of the next module.

- Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.

    1. Company consult scheduling system: Users can create and manage appointments for an offered service. Admins could create a list of services, availability, and manage the user information and appointment history. 
    2. Company Blog management system: Users can create, read, update and delete their own blog posts. Admins manage and approve all the content before they are published to ensure high quality and appropriate content.
