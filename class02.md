# The Coder's Computer Notes

#### What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

#### What do the following commands do?
Basic commands used in the command line interface of a Unix-based operating system such as Linux or macOS. 

1. `pwd`: Stands for "print working directory." It shows the current working directory, which is the directory in the file system where the user is currently located.

2. `ls`: Stands for "list." It shows the contents of the current directory, which can include files, directories, and other types of files.

3. `cd`: Stands for "change directory." It is used to navigate through the file system and change the current working directory to a new location.

4. `mkdir`: Stands for "make directory." It creates a new directory (folder) in the file system with the specified name.

5. `touch`: Used to create a new file in the file system with the specified name. If the file already exists, it updates the timestamp of the file.

#### Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

1. `cd projects`: Changes current directory to the "projects" directory.

2. `mkdir new-project`: Creates a new directory named "new-project" inside the "projects" directory.

3. `touch new-project/newfile.md`: Creates a new file named "newfile.md" inside the "new-project" directory.

4. `cd ..`: Changes the current directory to the parent directory.

5. `ls projects/new-project`: Lists the contents of the "new-project" directory inside the "projects" directory. Since we created a file called "newfile.md" inside that directory, if it is listed then we can confirm the new file was created successfully.
