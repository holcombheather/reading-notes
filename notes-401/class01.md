# Class 01: Node Ecosystem
[Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

    Node is a technology that allows developers to run JavaScript code to do more things than just make websites. It helps run JavaScript on different devices, like computers and servers, to make all sorts of apps.

2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
    Saying *Node is a JavaScript runtime* means that it's a helper that lets you run JavaScript code as a standalone program (similar to other languages like Python or Java). It comes with everything you need (infrastructure and resources) to make JavaScript work on its own, not just in web browsers. It also includes a set of libraries, tools, and a runtime environment that allows JavaScript programs to be executed on servers or other devices. 

3. What is Node used for?

    Node is used for for building server-side applications, such as web servers and APIs. With Node, developers can use JavaScript on both the server and the client, simplifying the overall development process and allowing you to build full stack applications with the same language.
    
    Node is also great for making tools that help people do their work faster. It can be used for building command-line tools, scripting tasks, and automation processes. With the Node Package Manager (npm),  developers can easily integrate third-party libraries and extend the functionality of their applications.
