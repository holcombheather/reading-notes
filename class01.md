# Markdown Reading Notes

***

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text in a simple and easy-to-read way. It is often used for writing documentation, web content, and other types of online content. The main advantage of using Markdown is that it allows users to create well-formatted content with a simple syntax, which can be easily converted to HTML or other formats.

Markdown uses a series of characters to denote headings, emphasis, lists, links, and other formatting options. For example, to create a heading, a user can simply add a "#" before the text of the heading. To add emphasis, a user can use asterisks or underscores to enclose the text they want to emphasize.

### Why do we use Markdown? 

Markdown is designed to be human-readable and easy to use, with a focus on simplicity and clarity. It is widely supported by many applications and platforms, including blogging software, wikis, and version control systems.

Overall, Markdown provides a convenient and efficient way to format text for online content, making it easier to create and publish high-quality documentation, web content, and other types of online content.

### Examples of the most commonly used Markdown syntax:

###### Headings:
To create a heading, use the "#" symbol followed by a space and the text of the heading. For example:

    # This is a level 1 heading
    ## This is a level 2 heading
    ### This is a level 3 heading


###### Bold and Italic Text:

To bold text, enclose it in double asterisks or double underscores. To italicize text, enclose it in single asterisks or single underscores. For example:

    This text will be **bold**
    This text will also be __bold__

    This text will be *italicized*
    This text will also be _italicized_

###### Lists:

> To create an unordered list, use a dash or an asterisk before each list item. To create an ordered list, use numbers followed by a period. For example:
>
>- Item 1
>- Item 2
>- Item 3
>
>1. First item
>2. Second item
>3. Third item

###### Links:

>To create a link, enclose the text of the link in square brackets, followed by the URL in parentheses. For example:
>
>[Visit Google](https://www.google.com/)

###### Images:

>To display an image, use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets containing the alt text, and parentheses containing the image URL. For example:
>
>![Alt text]()

These are just a few examples of the most commonly used Markdown syntax. There are many other formatting options available, including blockquotes, code blocks, tables, and more.
