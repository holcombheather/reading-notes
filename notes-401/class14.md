# Event Driven Architecture


## [Read today’s Lab Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-14/lab/)

Note: Requirement is to spend one lab session working on this project, however additional time may be an option. Due date will be given in class and we’ll present briefly at the beginning of the next module.

1. Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.
  - Real-time customer support and chatbot: customer support system that uses event-driven notifications to handle customer questions, route conversations to the appropriate support room (deliveries, returns, etc) and provide instant responses based on AI-powered chatbots. 
  - Real-time service availability and waitlist for a small business: Build a system that allows customers to check real-time availability of a small business providing a service and join a waitlist if their preferred time slot is unavailable. The system can utilize event-driven notifications to inform customers when a spot becomes available, enabling them to book the appointment instantly or within a specified timeframe.
