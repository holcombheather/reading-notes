# Class 01: Node Ecosystem
[Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

    Node is a technology that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides an environment where JavaScript can be executed on servers or other computing devices, making it a versatile tool for building various types of applications.

2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

    When we say that Node is a JavaScript runtime, it means that it provides the necessary infrastructure and resources for executing JavaScript code. It includes a set of libraries, tools, and a runtime environment that allows JavaScript programs to be executed on servers or other devices. In simpler terms, Node enables JavaScript to run as a standalone program, just like other programming languages such as Python or Java.

3. What is Node used for?

    Node is used for a wide range of purposes in web development and beyond. It is particularly popular for building server-side applications, such as web servers and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). With Node, developers can create efficient and scalable server-side applications using JavaScript, which is also used for client-side programming in web browsers. This means that developers can use the same language (JavaScript) on both the server and the client, simplifying the overall development process.

    Additionally, Node is often used for building command-line tools, scripting tasks, and automation processes. It provides a rich ecosystem of packages and modules through the Node Package Manager (npm), allowing developers to easily integrate third-party libraries and extend the functionality of their applications. Overall, Node offers a powerful and flexible platform for building a wide range of applications and has gained significant popularity in the developer community.
