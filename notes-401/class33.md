[**Role Based Access Control (RBAC)**:](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-role-based-access-control-rbac-examples-benefits-and-more)

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a system for managing users' access to a system or network resources based on their roles within the organization. In RBAC, permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned roles. Therefore, users gain permissions not by explicit assignments, but indirectly through their roles.

**Example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles**:

Let's assume a simple web application with three roles: `Admin`, `Editor`, and `Viewer`.

- `Admin` has access to all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. They can create, read, update, and delete any resource in the application.
- `Editor` has limited CRUD operations: they can create, read, and update resources, but cannot delete them.
- `Viewer` has only one operation: they can read (view) resources but cannot create, update, or delete them.

**Benefits of RBAC**:

1. **Improved operational efficiency**: Role-based access control can help simplify administration. Administrators can manage user roles in groups rather than individually, reducing potential errors and oversights.

2. **Enhanced compliance capabilities**: RBAC systems can support organizations in meeting regulatory and legal compliance requirements by limiting access to sensitive data.

3. **Reduced risk of data breaches**: With RBAC, the principle of least privilege can be effectively implemented, ensuring users have just enough permissions necessary to perform their tasks and nothing more. This reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of data.

## Compare and Contrast the following two libraries: 
- [react-cookie library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie)
- [react-cookies component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookies)

**Comparison of React Cookie Libraries**:

`react-cookie` and `react-cookies` are both libraries used to manage cookies in React applications. They provide features that help in reading, setting, and deleting cookies.

**react-cookie features**:

- Hooks: `useCookies` hook is used for reading, setting and removing cookies.
- `withCookies` HOC (Higher Order Component) for class-based components.
- `CookiesProvider` for providing cookies to nested components.
- Universal rendering (works with server-side rendering).

**react-cookies features**:

- Provides utility functions to load, save, and remove cookies.
- Universal rendering (works with server-side rendering).

While both libraries provide similar functionalities, the `react-cookie` library is a bit more up-to-date with modern React practices, providing a hook-based API (`useCookies`) that makes it more preferable for projects using functional components and hooks. The library you prefer to use ultimately depends on your specific use case, the project requirements, and the coding style of your team. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the `react-cookie` library appears to be more actively maintained and widely used in the community, making it a safer choice for most applications.
