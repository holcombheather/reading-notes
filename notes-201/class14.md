# Psychological Safety

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?


## 1. Three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams are:

    - Conversational turn-taking: Ensuring that every team member has an opportunity to contribute and be heard in discussions, without fear of being interrupted or dismissed.

    - Empathy: The ability to understand and share the feelings of others on the team, creating a sense of mutual support and respect.

    - A willingness to discuss norms and address problems: Teams that are able to discuss and address issues constructively, without fear of retribution or blame, are more likely to create a safe and inclusive environment.

2. In a previous professional setting, I worked in a team that lacked psychological safety. Members of the team were often dismissive of each other's ideas, and there was a culture of blame and finger-pointing when things went wrong. This created a stressful and unproductive work environment, where team members were reluctant to speak up and share their thoughts and opinions.

    Alternatively, I've worked on teams where we really valued the diverse experience of each team members - even intentionally prompting viewpoints from team members that had no prior experience or knowledge in a particular area becuase we could balance the perspective of the SME with a complete outside in persepctive. 

3. Teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have a positive impact on their company and team members. They are more likely to innovate, collaborate, and take risks, leading to greater productivity and success. In addition, team members are more likely to feel fulfilled and engaged in their work when they feel that their contributions are valued and respected. This can lead to greater job satisfaction, lower turnover rates, and improved overall well-being.
