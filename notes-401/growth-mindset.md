### Assess your emotional intelligence. 

[Survey Link](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/201/emotional-intelligence-assessment.pdf)

- Self Awareness 
	4+3+3+2+3=15 
- Self Management
	3+4+3+3+4=17 
- Social Awareness
	4+4+4+3+3=18 
- Relationship Management
	4+3+3+3+3=16 

    I had two scores below 18: self awareness (15) and self management (17). I was surprised given that I consider myself fairly self aware and somewhat disciplined. After reflecting on the assessment, I admit that I struggle with identifying different underlying emotions at any given moment and identifying my triggers before they trigger me. In order to regulate my emotions effectively, I need to better recognize my triggers and the conditions that make them more likely to occur and then learn how best to anticipate and manage them. 
    
    This course will be a great opportunity to improve my emotional intelligence in these areas since learning something new is guaranteed to trigger strong feelings like frustration, overwhelm and embarrassment at some point. It'll be interesting to see if I can identify these emotions as they are happening and figure out what strategies work best for me to manage them. 

### Assess your biases.

I achieved a score of 109 on the assessment, which shows that there is more that I can do even if this is not a topic you can ever master. It has become crucial for me to educate myself about the various forms of bias and their manifestations in the work environment. I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to learn and collaborate with individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences, as it enriches my understanding. Strengthening my active listening and communication skills is also vital in order to genuinely understand and empathize with others. Moreover, I am committed to being vigilant and proactive in addressing instances of bias, and I aspire to work alongside my colleagues and superiors to foster a work environment that is inclusive and equitable for all.
