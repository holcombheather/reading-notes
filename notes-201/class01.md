### Getting Started

###### Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

Let me tell of HTTP's way,
Sending data, no delay.
Computers send packets of information,
Verified for a safe destination.
When the packets come together,
The message is displayed, no bother.
HTTP, the language they all know,
Sends data across the land, a flow!

###### Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

When a user requests a webpage, the browser retrieves the HTML, CSS, and JS files associated with the page from the server. The browser then parses the HTML file and constructs a Document Object Model (DOM) tree, which represents the page's structure. The CSS file is then parsed and applied to the elements in the DOM tree, determining their style and layout. Finally, the JS file is executed, and any changes to the DOM or CSS are made dynamically as a result of the JS code.

###### How can you find images to add to a Website?

Search engines like Google Images or Bing Images
Stock photo websites like Shutterstock or iStock
Free stock photo websites like Unsplash or Pexels
Creating your own images or graphics using tools like Adobe Photoshop or Canva

###### How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (either single or double quotes), while a number is a numerical value (integer or decimal) without quotes. 

###### What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. Variables are important because they allow us to store and manipulate data in our code.

### Intro to HTML

###### What is an HTML attribute?

An HTML attribute is a characteristic of an HTML element that provides additional information about the element. Attributes are defined in the opening tag of an HTML element and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. For example, the "href" attribute in an "a" element specifies the URL of the link, like this:

`<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a>`


###### Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.

The anatomy of an HTML element consists of several parts:

- Opening tag: This is the first part of the element and identifies the type of element being used, usually enclosed in angle brackets. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag for a paragraph element.
- Attribute: This is an optional part of the opening tag and provides additional information about the element. Attributes are written as name-value pairs separated by an equals sign within the opening tag. For example, `<a href="https://www.example.com">` is the opening tag for a hyperlink element with an "href" attribute specifying the URL.
- Content: This is the part of the element that appears between the opening and closing tags and contains the actual text or other elements to be displayed. For example, Click here is the content of the hyperlink element in the example above.
- Closing tag: This is the final part of the element and identifies the end of the element, also enclosed in angle brackets. For example, `</p>` is the closing tag for a paragraph element.

###### What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?

The `<article>` and `<section>` elements are both used to organize content on a webpage, but they have different meanings. The `<section>` element is used to group related content together, while the `<article>` element is used to represent a self-contained piece of content that could potentially be distributed or reused on its own. In other words, a `<section>` is a part of a larger whole, while an `<article>` is a standalone piece of content.

###### What Elements does a “typical” website include?

- Header
- Body/Main content area
- Navigation/Sidebar
- Footer
- Images
- Forms
- Links


###### How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

Metadata is information about a webpage that is not visible to users but can be read by search engines and other software. Metadata can include information like the page title, description, keywords, and author, among other things. This information can be used by search engines to better understand the content and context of the page, which can help improve its ranking in search results.

###### How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

The `<meta>` HTML tag is used to specify metadata about a webpage. This tag is placed in the `<head>` section of an HTML document and can include attributes like "name", "content", and "charset". The "name" attribute is used to identify the type of metadata being provided, such as "description" or "keywords". The "content" attribute provides the actual value of the metadata, such as a description of the page or a list of relevant keywords. The "charset" attribute specifies the character encoding used by the webpage, which can affect how the page is displayed and processed by software.

### Misc

#### Website Design

###### What is the first step to designing a website?

Define its purpose and goals. This involves understanding the target audience, the desired user experience, and the specific objectives that the website is intended to achieve. It may also involve conducting research on competitors or best practices in the industry.

###### What is the most important question to answer when desiging a website? 

"What problem am I solving for my users?" A website should be designed with the user in mind, and its purpose should be to address a specific need or challenge that the user has. Understanding the user's needs and goals is critical to designing an effective and engaging website.

#### Semantics

###### Why should you use an <h1> element over a <span> element to display a top level heading?

You should use an `<h1>` element over a `<span>` element to display a top-level heading because the `<h1>` element is a semantic tag that provides meaning and context to the content. The `<h1>` tag tells the browser and search engines that this is the main heading of the page, and it also helps users understand the structure and hierarchy of the content. In contrast, the `<span>` element is a generic tag that does not provide any semantic meaning to the content.

###### What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

The benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML include improved accessibility, better search engine optimization, and easier maintenance and development. Semantic tags provide additional meaning and context to the content, which can help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure and meaning of the page. They also provide clues to search engines about the content of the page, which can help improve its ranking in search results. Finally, using semantic tags can make the code more readable and maintainable, as it provides a clear and consistent structure for the content.

#### What is JavaScript? 

###### Describe 2 things that require JavaScript in the Browser?

- **User interfaces**: JavaScript allows developers to create interactive elements like drop-down menus, sliders, and pop-ups that respond to user input in real-time. 

- **Dynamic content**: Content of the page can be updated or modified based on user interactions or other events.

###### How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document?

- Inline script: This involves adding the JavaScript code directly into the HTML document using the `<script>` element.

- External script: This involves linking to an external JavaScript file using the `<script>` element's "src" attribute. 

- Event handlers: This involves using HTML attributes like "onclick" or "onload" to execute JavaScript code in response to specific events.
