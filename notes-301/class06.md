# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

### 1. Who is Roy Fielding? 

    Roy Fielding is a computer scientist who is known for his contributions to the development of the World Wide Web and the HTTP protocol. He was one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and played a key role in the development of other web-related technologies, including URIs and HTML.

### 2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

 In order to communicate with all machines in the world, we need to use standardized, platform-independent protocols and technologies that can be used by any machine, regardless of its operating system or programming language.

### 3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging data between web servers and clients. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. Roy Fielding was one of the primary authors of the HTTP specification, which was first published in 1991.

### 4. What does a GET do?

    A GET request is used to retrieve data from a web server. When a client sends a GET request to a server, it is asking for a particular resource, such as a web page or an image file, to be returned to the client.

### 5. What does a POST do?

    A POST request is used to submit data to a web server. When a client sends a POST request to a server, it is asking the server to process the data and possibly update the server's state or database.

### 6. What does PUT do?

    A PUT request is used to update an existing resource on a web server. When a client sends a PUT request to a server, it is asking the server to replace the existing resource with the new data provided in the request.

### 7. What does PATCH do?

    A PATCH request is used to update a portion of an existing resource on a web server. When a client sends a PATCH request to a server, it is asking the server to apply a partial modification to the existing resource.
