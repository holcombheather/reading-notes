# Structure web pages with HTML

## What is HTML and why do we use it?

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides a way to describe the structure and content of a web page, including text, images, videos, links, and more.

## What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

The three main parts of an HTML element are the opening tag, the closing tag, and the content. The opening tag consists of the element name enclosed in angle brackets (< >). The closing tag has the same element name, but with a forward slash (/) before the name. The content is the information or text contained within the tags.

## What is it called when you give an element extra information? 

When you give an element extra information, it's called an _attribute_. An attribute provides additional information about an element and is added to the opening tag. For example, the <img> element uses the "src" attribute to specify the URL of the image to display on the page.

# What is a semantic element? 

A semantic element is an HTML element that gives meaning to the content it contains. It is a descriptive tag that describes the content it surrounds, rather than just defining how the content should look. Examples of semantic elements in HTML5 include: 
> `<header>`

> `<nav>` 

> `<article>` 

> `<aside>`

> `<footer>` 

> `<strong>`

Using semantic elements can improve the accessibility, search engine optimization, and readability of a web page, as well as make it easier to maintain and update the code.
