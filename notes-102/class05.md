## What is the purpose of CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XML (Extensible Markup Language) documents. The purpose of CSS is to separate the presentation of a document from its content, allowing developers to apply consistent styles and layout across multiple pages.

## What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

There are three ways to insert CSS into your project:

__External CSS__: Create a separate CSS file with the .css extension and link it to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section. For example:

__Internal CSS__: Insert CSS rules directly into the `<head>` section of your HTML document using the `<style>` tag. For example:

__Inline CSS__: Add CSS styles directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.

## Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all `<p> `elements red text.

> p {
>
>  color: red;
>
>}
