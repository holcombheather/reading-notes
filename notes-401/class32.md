# React - Context API - Behaviors

## [Scaling Up with Reducer and Context](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context)

`useReducer` and `useContext` are powerful hooks in React that, when used together, provide a robust and scalable solution for managing state in large applications. This combination addresses both the need for handling complex state and making that state accessible across the entire application without excessive "prop drilling".

The `useReducer` hook is essentially a way to manage complex state in a predictable manner. It works similarly to how reducers function in Redux: you define a reducer function that determines how the state should change based on a given action, and `useReducer` gives you the current state and a dispatch function to trigger those changes. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex state transitions, or when the next state depends on the previous one. It provides a centralized way of handling all state transitions, thereby ensuring a single source of truth and more predictable and easier-to-debug code.

On the other hand, `useContext` allows you to create a "context" for your state, effectively providing a way to share state across your component tree without having to pass props down multiple levels. This solves the issue of "prop drilling" where you'd have to pass state down through intermediate components just so a deeply nested component can access it. When `useReducer` is used in combination with `useContext`, not only is the state accessible across components, but so is the dispatch function returned by `useReducer`. This means that any component within your application can trigger state changes using the dispatch function, providing a powerful and flexible way to manage and share complex state.
