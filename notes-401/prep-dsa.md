#### 1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

Choosing the right data structure depends on your problem and the tasks that need to be performed in order to solve that problem. You want to choose a data structure that will have the best performance trade-offs for what matters most to solving your problem (ideally with an understanding of the target customer). 

#### 2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

When you write a recursive function, you have to tell it when to stop recursing. Make sure every recursive function has two parts: the base case an the recursive case.
