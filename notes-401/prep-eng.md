### 1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

One thing I bring to this career that differentiates me is my unique combination of expertise in software development, product management, and product strategy. My skills in software development equip me with a deep understanding of the technical aspects of building software products, while my experience as a product manager and strategist allows me to craft and execute strategic roadmaps that align with business goals and user needs. This distinctive blend of skills empowers me to offer creative, data-driven solutions that take into account both the technical feasibility and the overall product vision.

### 2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Sticking to the 15-minute rule and asking for help while I'm in the course. Beyond Code Fellows, I will timebox my attempts and ask for help.
- Stepping back and reading the problem again. I will start by reading the problem completely twice at the beginning, but if I get stuck, I will go back and revisit it an additional time. I will also leverage my understanding of the customer to put myself in their position, ensuring I am solving the right problem and approaching it from their perspective.
- Trying to solve the problem manually with at least 3 sets of data and then optimizing from there.
