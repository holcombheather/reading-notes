## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

1. What is node.js?

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on top of the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript to build scalable, high-performance applications.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine can execute code either within or outside of a browser - making server-side scripting possible. It also compiles JS into optimized machine code before execution so it's faster. 

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

Node being a JavaScript runtime means that it allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides an environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side, making it possible to build server-side applications using JavaScript.

4. What is npm?

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to easily install and manage third-party libraries and modules needed for their projects.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

v19.6.1

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

9.4.0

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

`npm install jshint`

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

    * Improved code quality
    * Better learning and knowledge transfer
    * Enhanced team communication
    * Increased productivity
    * Better job satisfaction
    * Reduced development costs and time

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

I've learned a lot from other students and seeing how they approach problems in a different way than I do. Also, it's a great way to share knowledge. Even if I think I understand a topic, I benefit from trying to explain it to someone else. 

3. How does pair programming work?

Pair programming involves two developers working on the same task at the same workstation. One developer is the "driver," responsible for typing code, while the other is the "navigator," responsible for reviewing and guiding the code. The two developers switch roles frequently, ensuring that both are engaged and contributing to the task.
