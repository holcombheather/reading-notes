### Growth Mindset 

A growth mindset is a way of thinking about one's abilities and intelligence that emphasizes the _potential_ for growth and development through effort and learning.

1. I embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and learning.
2. I believe in my ability to learn and improve over time.
3. I am open to feedback and use it to improve myself.
